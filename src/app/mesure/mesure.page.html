               <p>

                   Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
                    If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.
                    Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.

                  Keeping distance from others is especially important for people who are at higher risk of getting very sick.

               <p>


                 You could spread COVID-19 to others even if you do not feel sick.
                Everyone should wear a cloth face cover when they have to go out in public, for example to the grocery store or to pick up other necessities.
                Cloth face coverings should not be placed on young children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.
                The cloth face cover is meant to protect other people in case you are infected.
                Do NOT use a facemask meant for a healthcare worker.
                Continue to keep about 6 feet between yourself and others. The cloth face cover is not a substitute for social distancing.

                              If you are in a private setting and do not have on your cloth face covering, remember to always cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or use the inside of your elbow.
                              Throw used tissues in the trash.
                              Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, clean your hands with a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
